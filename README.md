### What I Learned
Throughout all these projects, I was able to apply the knowledge and skills accquired through self-studying to be able to complete these challenging projects. I have learnt how to write clean code and the importance of refactoring code. I was also able to practice my JavaScript skills and have now become more proficient at it.
